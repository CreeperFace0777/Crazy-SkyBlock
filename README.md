This plugin was originially made for another server, as a request, and is still in the Development Stage.
the goal of this plugin is to make a SkyBlock server, where you can raid other people's islands, and gain resources. It is supposed to be like SkyWars, but on a huge scale, and more of a 1 on 1; We have spent countless hours on this plugin.
